I have always been a tinkerer, I love to craft - Pinterest is my jam, but with coding Iâ€™ve really never felt like I have been able to get to a place where I could tinker. [Atul](https://twitter.com/toolness) convinced me to apply for this fellowship because it would give me a chance to experiment and learn p5 in order to tinker with code in a lightweight way, so that we could help other designers and artists who, like me, might be enthusiastic but just a bit overwhelmed with code.
